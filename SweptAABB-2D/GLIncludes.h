Description:
This is a Swept Axis Aligned Bounding Box collision test. This goes beyond a standard
AABB test to determine the time and axis of collision. This is in 2D.
Contains two squares, one that is stationary and one that is moving. They are bounded
by AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) and when these AABBs collide the moving object
"bounces" on the axis of collision.
There is a physics timestep such that every update runs at the same delta time, regardless
of how fast or slow the computer is running. The Swept portion of this algorithm determines
when the collision will actually happen (so if your velocity is 10, and you are a distance
of 5 away from the collision, it will detect this) and will perform the collision response
(bounce, in this case) before the end of the frame, so you can prevent tunneling (where the
object passes through or into the middle of the colliding object).
